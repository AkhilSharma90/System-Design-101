# **🖥️ System Testing:**


System testing verifies the **entire integrated system** meets requirements, testing it as a complete product.

System Testing \= Integration Testing \+ Full Environment

Not just: Do services talk to each other?
But: Does the entire system work in production-like environment?

### **Real-World Analogy:**

**Like testing an entire airplane before first passenger flight:**

Component Testing: Each part tested (✅ done)

Integration Testing: Parts work together (✅ done)

System Testing: Complete airplane test

✓ Can it taxi on runway?

✓ Can it take off?

✓ Can it fly at cruising altitude?

✓ Can it land safely?

✓ Do all systems work together (navigation, fuel, hydraulics)?

✓ Can it handle turbulence?

Test the COMPLETE system as passengers will experience it\!

### **System Test Example: Banking Application**

System Under Test:

\- Web frontend (React)

\- Mobile app (iOS/Android)

\- API gateway

\- Authentication service

\- Account service

\- Transaction service

\- Notification service

\- Database cluster

\- Message queue

\- External payment gateway


System Test Scenario: "Fund Transfer"

Prerequisites:

✓ Production-like environment deployed

✓ Test data loaded (accounts, balances)

✓ All services running

✓ External systems configured (mocked or sandbox)

Test Steps:

1\. User logs in via web app

   Verify: ✓ Session created

   Verify: ✓ Dashboard loads with account balance

2\. User navigates to transfer page

   Verify: ✓ Account list populated

   Verify: ✓ Available balance correct

3\. User initiates transfer ($500)

   Input: Recipient account, amount, note

   Verify: ✓ Validation works (sufficient funds)

   Verify: ✓ Confirmation screen shown

4\. User confirms transfer

   Verify: ✓ Transaction processes

   Verify: ✓ Sender balance decreases

   Verify: ✓ Recipient balance increases

   Verify: ✓ Transaction logged in database

5\. System sends notifications

   Verify: ✓ SMS sent to sender

   Verify: ✓ Email sent to sender

   Verify: ✓ Push notification to mobile app

6\. User checks mobile app

   Verify: ✓ Transaction appears in history

   Verify: ✓ Balance updated

   Verify: ✓ Transaction details correct

7\. System processes batch jobs (overnight)

   Verify: ✓ Daily summary generated

   Verify: ✓ Audit logs created

   Verify: ✓ Compliance reports generated

All components working together in complete system\! ✅

### **Types of System Testing:**

#### **1\. Functional System Testing**

Test: Complete business workflows

\- User registration flow

\- Purchase flow

\- Refund flow

\- Account closure flow

Each flow touches multiple subsystems

#### **2\. Non-Functional System Testing**

Test: System qualities

\- Performance (response times under load)

\- Security (penetration testing)

\- Usability (can users navigate easily?)

\- Reliability (uptime, error rates)

\- Scalability (handles growth?)

#### **3\. Recovery Testing**

Test: System recovery from failures

Simulate failures:

1\. Kill database mid-transaction

   Expected: ✓ Transaction rolled back

   Expected: ✓ User sees error message

   Expected: ✓ System remains stable

2\. Restart application server

   Expected: ✓ In-flight requests handled gracefully

   Expected: ✓ New requests succeed after restart

3\. Network partition

   Expected: ✓ System detects partition

   Expected: ✓ Failover to backup

### **System Testing Environment:**

Production-like "Staging" Environment:


\[Load Balancer\] (Same config as prod)

       ↓
\[App Servers\] (Same scale as prod)

       ↓
\[Databases\] (Replicated setup)

       ↓
\[Cache Layer\] (Redis cluster)

       ↓
\[Message Queue\] (RabbitMQ/Kafka)

       ↓
\[External APIs\] (Sandbox/mocked)


As close to production as possible\!

**Key characteristics:**

* 🎭 **End-to-end scope:** Entire system, all components
* 🌍 **Production-like environment:** Realistic infrastructure
* 📋 **Requirements verification:** Does it meet all specs?
* 🔄 **Multiple user workflows:** Real usage scenarios
